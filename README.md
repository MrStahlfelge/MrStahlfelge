### Hi there 👋

🎮 You'll find mostly libGDX related libraries here, and [Falling Lightblocks OSS](https://github.com/MrStahlfelge/lightblocks), of course.

🤝 More libraries I am maintaining or contributing are part of the [libGDX organisation](https://github.com/libgdx).

📖 I wrote some [libGDX-related articles on medium](https://medium.com/@bschulte19e), too.

☕ If you like my work and it helps you, [consider spending me a coffee](https://ko-fi.com/B0B51Z9YB).
